2. Term and Termination
2.1 Term. Initially, you may elect to participate in a free trial of the Service when you open an Account.  During this trial period, you will have access to the complete range of features and functions available with the Service.  For more details about the free trial of the Service, please visit the Site. Upon expiration of the trial period, you will lose access to the Service and you may register as a paid subscriber for the Service.  This Agreement shall run for the duration of the trial period or the fixed term you select when you subscribe to the Service and any subsequent subscription renewal terms (the “Term”).  You are solely responsible for properly terminating your account, or renewing this Agreement at the end of the Term on KeyedIn’s then prevailing payment terms and prices. This Agreement may only be terminated during the Term in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement.  
2.2 Termination for Cause. If either party fails to comply with any of the material terms and conditions of this Agreement, including without limitation the payment of any fees or other reimbursement due and payable to KeyedIn under this Agreement, the non-defaulting party may terminate this Agreement and any and all license rights upon thirty (30) days' written notice to the defaulting party specifying any such breach, unless within the period of such notice, all breaches specified therein shall have been remedied. Either party may terminate this Agreement upon: (i) the institution of insolvency, bankruptcy, or similar proceedings by or against the other party, (ii) any assignment or attempted assignment by the other party for the benefit of creditors, or (iii) any appointment, or application for such appointment, of a receiver for the other party. Termination is not an exclusive remedy for KeyedIn and KeyedIn reserves all other available remedies in contract, tort, or negligence, by law or at equity.
2.3 Termination for Convenience. KeyedIn, at its sole discretion, has the right to suspend or terminate your Account and this Agreement and refuse any and all current or future use of the Service, for any reason at any time without any liability to you. You may also terminate this Agreement and your Account at any time by notifying KeyedIn of termination, provided that no refund will be made for payments already made by you and that all payments that would have been due by you to KeyedIn throughout the remaining Term if such termination had not taken place shall immediately become payable in full by you to KeyedIn.
2.4 Effect of Termination. Upon termination of this Agreement, you and any Authorised Users must immediately stop using the Service, return or destroy all documentation, and certify such return or destruction in writing. Termination of the Service will result in the deactivation or deletion of your Account or your access to your Account, and the forfeiture of any and all of your content in your Account. All of your content will be stored in the Site's database for a period of time following the termination of your Account (the &quot;Storage Period&quot;).  The Storage Period is defined as 30 days if you have paid KeyedIn to use the Service and seven days if you are participating in the free trial of the Service. Upon the end of the Storage Period all your content will be permanently deleted from the Site's or third-party host’s servers. Once deleted, this information cannot be recovered.  If this Agreement is terminated (other than by reason of your breach as provided in Section 2.2) and provided you have paid KeyedIn to use the Service, KeyedIn will make available to you during the Storage Period a file of your content, if you so request at time of termination. 
2.5 Survival. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, all sections of this Agreement that, by their nature, should survive termination or expiration of this Agreement, will survive termination or expiration of this Agreement, including, without limitation, Sections 2.3, 2.4, 2.5, 3, 5, 6.1, 6.3, 7, and 10. 
3. Fees and Payment
3.1 Fees. You shall pay KeyedIn for use of the Service in accordance with the fee schedule provided based on the subscription and payment terms you select when you subscribe to the Service (the “Fee Schedule”). All fees are due and payable in U.S. dollars. Each payment of your subscription fee will grant you access to your Account for the duration of the Term in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement. All fees are non-refundable unless otherwise provided by law. Notwithstanding the foregoing, you will be given a refund of the subscription fees you have paid in advance for the unused portions of the Term if the Service is permanently discontinued by KeyedIn or if this Agreement or your Account is terminated by KeyedIn for any reason other than for cause as provided in Section 2.2.  KeyedIn will not change the price payable by you for the Service during the initial Term of this Agreement.  If you elect to renew the Service after the initial Term, the then-current prices offered by KeyedIn for the Service will apply to any such renewal periods.  
3.2 Billing and Payment Terms. Payments for the Service shall be made by the payment method you select when you subscribe to the Service. If you choose to have payments automatically charged to an authorised credit card provided by you, you will be prompted to provide financial information, including credit card and other billing information, directly to a secure third party credit card payment processing service to process and charge your subscription fee.  The credit card payment processor will not share your financial information with us and we will not store any such information on our servers.  By subscribing to the Service and selecting the credit card payment method, you authorise the credit card payment processor to charge you the subscription fee automatically in accordance with your Fee Schedule and any other charges you may incur with the Service. Any invoices issued by KeyedIn must be paid in accordance with your Fee Schedule. If payment is not made within 15 days after the respective due date, KeyedIn may charge you a late fee on the unpaid balance at the lesser of 1.5% per month or the maximum lawful rate permitted by applicable law, rounded to the next highest whole month and compounded monthly. Should you not pay amounts when due, KeyedIn may also (at its discretion and in addition to other remedies it may have) suspend your and any Authorised Users’ access to the Service.
3.3 Taxes. The fees for the Service exclude all sales, value-added, use, or similar taxes unless expressly stated otherwise. To the maximum extent permitted by law, you shall pay such taxes and charges in full, except for taxes based on KeyedIn’s net income. To the extent that such taxes and charges are borne by KeyedIn then such taxes and charges shall be added to the price payable by you to KeyedIn.
4. Support and Maintenance; Service Availability
4.1 Helpdesk. KeyedIn provides a range of online support that includes video tutorials and access to user forums.  In addition, KeyedIn will provide helpdesk support in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.  The helpdesk should be considered as the single entry point for both functional and technical matters and issues.  You will designate one support contact as the responsible party for communication with KeyedIn during the provision of the Service and all customer queries must be channelled through your designated support contact. Communication with the Helpdesk will be via the following email account support@keyedinprojects.com.
4.2 Upgrades and Updates. Future versions of the Service may be developed and released by KeyedIn at its sole discretion. KeyedIn does not warrant or represent that it will develop or release any upgrades within a given timeframe. 
4.3 Availability of the Service. KeyedIn may host the Service using its own infrastructure or it may engage a third party to host the Service on its behalf. KeyedIn operates a policy of providing Service credits for Service downtime, as provided in Schedule 1 of this Agreement.

If KeyedIn discontinues the Service permanently, you may be entitled to a refund of subscription fees as provided in Section 3.1 above.
